### A LaTeX template for thesis/dissertation documents at UC Irvine.

Adapted from a blog post here:

Credit goes to Trevor, the original author!

However, it seems he doesn't actively maintain it anymore, so I updated things a bit to comply (to the best of my knowledge) with the latest UCI Theses and Dissertation Manual for electronic filing as of Fall 2012:

Naturally, this template comes _without any guarantees whatsoever_, but if you find anything that's at odds with UCI requirements, now or in the future, feel free to submit a pull request or contact me directly.
